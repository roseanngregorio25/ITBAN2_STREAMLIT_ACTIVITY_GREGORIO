TASK1 
This Streamlit app offers a simple and friendly way for users to enter their information. When you open it, you’re greeted with a welcoming title and a clear prompt to fill out a short form. The form asks for your email address and a 4-digit PIN, with the PIN safely hidden as you type it. Once you hit "Submit," the app lets you know your information was received and then shows the email you entered, while keeping your PIN private by displaying it as asterisks. It’s a clean, straightforward experience designed to feel secure and easy to use.

TASK2
This also makes it easy for anyone to explore and filter data from a CSV file without needing any coding skills. When you open the app, you're asked to upload a CSV file using the sidebar. Once the file is uploaded, the app gives you a quick preview of the data so you can see what you're working with. You can choose to view the full raw dataset if needed. Then, using the sidebar, you can pick a column to filter and select specific values you’re interested in. The app instantly shows you the filtered results and even gives you the option to download them as a new CSV file. If you haven’t uploaded a file yet or selected any filter values, it gently reminds you to do so. It’s a user-friendly tool designed to make working with data feel simple and accessible.

TASK3
In this task, you will discover that this app is designed as a helpful learning tool for anyone wanting to understand the basics of Data Warehousing and Enterprise Data ManagemenT. When you open it, you’ll see a sidebar where you can pick a topic—like ETL processes, data integration, or performance tips—and the app will instantly show easy-to-digest explanations and examples related to that topic. There's also an expandable introduction section that gives you a quick overview of what data warehousing and EDM are all about.
To make the learning experience even richer, the app includes tabs at the bottom that dive into advanced topics like real-time analytics, cloud-based warehousing, and data archiving strategies. Whether you’re just starting out or brushing up on your knowledge, this app breaks down complex ideas into manageable, practical insights in a friendly, interactive format.

TASK4
Here, you will see a clear and interactive view of how COVID-19 has been trending in the past month for a country you select—like the USA, India, or the Philippines. Just choose a country from the sidebar, and it instantly shows you key numbers for the most recent day: new cases, new deaths, and new recoveries.
It also helps you visualize how these numbers have been changing daily with an easy-to-read line chart. Want a quick sense of the overall impact? There’s a pie chart showing the proportion of total cases, deaths, and recoveries. And if you're someone who likes digging into the raw numbers, you can check a box to view the full data table too. It’s a simple, informative dashboard that helps make sense of COVID-19 data at a glance.

TASK5
When you open it, you're asked to log in. If you enter the correct username and password, you're welcomed to the School Management Dashboard.
From there, you can look at two tables: one for faculty and another for subjects. You can see all the existing data, or filter it using custom queries—like only showing faculty from the Math department.
Want to add someone new? No problem—you just fill out a quick form, hit submit, and your new record gets added right to the database. It’s an easy, secure way for school admins or staff to view and update data without having to write raw SQL or use a complicated database interface.

TASK6
After launching, your camera turns on, and you see a live video feed. You can tweak the look in real time—brighten it up, boost the contrast, or have fun applying effects like black-and-white, soft blur, sketch-style edges, or even a warm sepia tone. When you’re happy with the look, just click the Take Snapshot button. The app instantly captures the current frame, saves it with today’s date and time, and lets you know the snapshot is saved. It’s a creative and playful tool for taking filtered selfies or experimenting with visual effects live.
